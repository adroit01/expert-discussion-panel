For small Fibonacci numbers, a simple iterative approach can be effective:\n\n```java\npublic class Fibonacci {\n    public static int fibonacci(int n) {\n        if (n <= 1)\n            return n;\n        int fib = 0;\n        int prevFib = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            fib = prevFib + fib;\n            prevFib = fib;\n        }\n        return fib;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(fibonacci(10));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor larger Fibonacci numbers, a more efficient approach is to use matrix exponentiation or recursive methods. These approaches can be optimized for large series sizes.\n\nIn Python, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\n        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])\n    return fib[n]\n\nprint(fibonacci(10))\n```\n\nThese are just a few examples of how to solve the Fibonacci series problem. The best approach depends on your specific needs and constraints.\n\n***OTHERS_STATEMENTS*** [] ***OTHERS_STATEMENTS***""]]], ""metadata"": null}",,,,2024-05-04 17:25:28.744445

Given the vast distances involved, I recommend dividing your journey into three parts: exploring the coastal regions of Goa and Kerala, immersing yourselves in South India's rich heritage, and finally, discovering the vibrant temples and beaches of Tamil Nadu.\n\nBegin by driving from Bangalore to Goa (around 560 km, 7-8 hours). Focus on the central and southern regions of Goa, which offer a more laid-back atmosphere than the northern parts. Must-visits include the historic Fort Aguada, the stunning Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa, and the iconic Church of St. Francis Xavier.\n\nNext, head to Kerala (around 430 km, 6-7 hours) and explore its picturesque backwaters, beaches, and hill stations. Take a houseboat cruise through Alleppey's serene canals, visit the tranquil Varkala Beach, and trek in the Munnar hills for breathtaking views. Don't miss the ancient temples of Kerala, such as the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nFinally, drive to Tamil Nadu (around 340 km, 5-6 hours) and experience its rich cultural heritage. Visit the iconic Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, explore the ancient city of Mahabalipuram, and relax on the stunning beaches of Rameswaram. Don't forget to try the local specialties, like dosas, idlis, and filter coffee.\n\nTo make your journey more enjoyable, consider booking accommodations in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Pack light and comfortable clothing for the varying climates you'll encounter. Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, and a first-aid kit as a precaution. Don't forget to capture memories along the way \u2013 bring a camera and enjoy the scenic views!\n\nBy dividing your journey into these three parts, you'll have ample time to soak in the unique experiences each region has to offer. With careful planning and flexibility, this road trip will be an unforgettable adventure for your family!```""]]], ""metadata"": null}",,,,2024-06-02 13:11:12.467881"Plan a 3 days trip to Odisha Puri for a family of 5 members(Mother, father, husband, wife and daughter)","{""headers"": [""Expert Details"", ""Status"", ""Avg.
